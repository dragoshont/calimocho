#
# Prepare a macOS Apple Silicon machine for building calimocho's Wine
# engine. Idempotent: safe to re-run.
#
# What this script does (and why it does each thing):
#
# 1.  Verifies macOS is Apple Silicon. The whole point of calimocho is
#     to run Windows games on M-series Macs; Intel Macs aren't a target.
#
# 2.  Installs Rosetta 2 if not present. We build the Wine engine as
#     x86_64 (ADR-0010) and run it under Rosetta on Apple Silicon —
#     exactly the way every shipping Wine-on-Mac stack does it
#     (Whisky's bundled Wine, CrossOver, GPTK, gcenx). Native arm64
#     Wine on macOS 26 is killed by AppleSystemPolicy at exec; root
#     cause documented in docs/build-log.md.
#
# 3.  Installs an **x86_64** Homebrew at /usr/local/. The native arm64
#     Homebrew at /opt/homebrew/ ships arm64-only formulae which we
#     can't link x86_64 binaries against. Both Homebrews coexist;
#     calimocho's build picks the x86 one via arch -x86_64.
#
# 4.  Installs the x86_64 brew formulae Wine needs:
#       gnutls       — SChannel/HTTPS in Wine (Steam login)
#       freetype     — text rendering
#       sdl2         — audio + gamepad backend
#       libpng       — texture decoding
#       dbus         — Wine's IPC bus
#       mingw-w64    — cross-compiler for the Win32 PE side of Wine
#       bison flex   — Apple's system versions are too old for Wine's parsers
#       pkg-config   — for ./configure to find the above
#
# 5.  Brews D3DMetal-side dependencies (none today — GPTK ships its
#     own framework; we copy it in scripts/overlay-gptk.sh).
#
# 6.  Prints next-steps banner (scripts/fetch-sources.sh, then
#     scripts/build-wine.sh).
#
# This script does NOT:
#   - Download Wine sources (that's scripts/fetch-sources.sh)
#   - Install GPTK (Apple gates it behind Apple ID; user downloads manually)
#   - Touch any system-wide policy (no spctl mutations, no SIP changes)
#
# Designed to work identically in:
#   - Local developer machine (interactive, prompts for sudo password)
#   - GitHub Actions self-hosted Apple Silicon runner (sudo is passwordless,
#     or NONINTERACTIVE=1 + a pre-existing /etc/sudoers.d entry)
