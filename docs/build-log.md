# calimocho — build log

Live notes from the build investigation. Will become structured docs once
the recipe is reliable.

## 2026-05-31 — Session 1: discovery + planning

### What we learned
- Whisky ships **Wine 7.7 + GPTK 1.1** (April 2023). Archived May 2025.
- Whisky's WhiskyWine CDN (`data.getwhisky.app`) is **dead (HTTP 404)**.
  Mirror via Wayback at `https://web.archive.org/web/20250824114303if_/https://data.getwhisky.app/Wine/Libraries.tar.gz`.
- Steam's current client uses **CEF/Chromium 128+** — needs syscalls only
  Wine 9+ provides. `steamwebhelper.exe` crashes on Whisky's Wine 7.7 with
  `LdrInitializeThunk ... status 80000003`.
- GPTK 3.0-3 (Apple, March 2026) still bundles **Wine 7.7**. Apple has
  never updated Wine. So GPTK 3 alone doesn't fix Steam.
- gcenx publishes upstream **Wine 11.9 staging** as a standalone tarball
  for macOS — works at the binary level but lacks CodeWeavers' macdrv
  patches → Steam UI renders as a **black window** (no chrome drawn).
- CodeWeavers publishes their full LGPL-compliant Wine source at
  `media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/source/crossover-sources-26.1.0.tar.gz`
  (142 MB). Confirmed Wine 11.0 + ~38 macdrv files with CW-specific patches.

### Path chosen
Build CodeWeavers-patched Wine 11 from source, overlay GPTK 3 D3DMetal
libraries, drop into Whisky's `Libraries/` folder.

### Next
- Toolchain: brew install bison@2.7 flex mingw-w64 gnutls freetype sdl2
  gstreamer pkg-config
- `./configure --enable-win64 --disable-tests --without-x` etc. for Apple
  Silicon
- Build, copy `wine64`, `wineserver`, `lib/wine/x86_64-{unix,windows}/`
  into Whisky's tree
- Overlay GPTK 3's `lib/external/{D3DMetal.framework, libd3dshared.dylib}`
- Verify Steam UI renders, then test SN2 launch

### Open risks
- The CW source includes vkd3d, dxvk, gstreamer, moltenvk — may need to
  build all of them or use system equivalents
- GPTK 3 D3DMetal was built against Wine 7's d3d12 stub ABI; Wine 11
  refactored this — may need a Wine 7-compatible d3d12.dll shim
- ANGLE / swiftshader interaction inside CEF is what makes Steam render
  on CrossOver; the patches that handle this may be in dlls/win32u or
  user32 rather than macdrv
