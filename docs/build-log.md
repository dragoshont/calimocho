# calimocho — build log

Live notes from the build investigation. Will become structured docs once
the recipe is reliable.

## 2026-05-31 — Session 1: discovery + planning

### What we learned
- Whisky ships **Wine 7.7 + GPTK 1.1** (April 2023). Archived May 2025.
- Whisky's WhiskyWine CDN (`data.getwhisky.app`) is **dead (HTTP 404)**.
  Mirror via Wayback at `https://web.archive.org/web/20250824114303if_/https://data.getwhisky.app/Wine/Libraries.tar.gz`.
- Steam's current client uses **CEF/Chromium 128+** — needs syscalls only
  Wine 9+ provides. `steamwebhelper.exe` crashes on Whisky's Wine 7.7 with
  `LdrInitializeThunk ... status 80000003`.
- GPTK 3.0-3 (Apple, March 2026) still bundles **Wine 7.7**. Apple has
  never updated Wine. So GPTK 3 alone doesn't fix Steam.
- gcenx publishes upstream **Wine 11.9 staging** as a standalone tarball
  for macOS — works at the binary level but lacks CodeWeavers' macdrv
  patches → Steam UI renders as a **black window** (no chrome drawn).
- CodeWeavers publishes their full LGPL-compliant Wine source at
  `media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/source/crossover-sources-26.1.0.tar.gz`
  (142 MB). Confirmed Wine 11.0 + ~38 macdrv files with CW-specific patches.

### Path chosen
Build CodeWeavers-patched Wine 11 from source, overlay GPTK 3 D3DMetal
libraries, drop into Whisky's `Libraries/` folder.

### Next
- Toolchain: brew install bison@2.7 flex mingw-w64 gnutls freetype sdl2
  gstreamer pkg-config
- `./configure --enable-win64 --disable-tests --without-x` etc. for Apple
  Silicon
- Build, copy `wine64`, `wineserver`, `lib/wine/x86_64-{unix,windows}/`
  into Whisky's tree
- Overlay GPTK 3's `lib/external/{D3DMetal.framework, libd3dshared.dylib}`
- Verify Steam UI renders, then test SN2 launch

### Open risks
- The CW source includes vkd3d, dxvk, gstreamer, moltenvk — may need to
  build all of them or use system equivalents
- GPTK 3 D3DMetal was built against Wine 7's d3d12 stub ABI; Wine 11
  refactored this — may need a Wine 7-compatible d3d12.dll shim
- ANGLE / swiftshader interaction inside CEF is what makes Steam render
  on CrossOver; the patches that handle this may be in dlls/win32u or
  user32 rather than macdrv

## To be continued...

## 2026-05-31 / 2026-06-01 — Session 2: Phase 1 engine, end to end

### Outcome

Phase 1 acceptance closed. A1.1, A1.2, A1.3, A1.5 PASS. A1.4 deferred
(Steam install is Phase 2/3 scope — requires the wizard's "Install
Steam" step which doesn't exist yet). A1.6 = this entry.

Engine artifact: `out/engine/` — x86_64 Mach-O Wine 11.0, ad-hoc
signed, runs under Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon. ~140 MB.

### Scripts written

- `scripts/fetch-sources.sh`        — sha256-pinned curl of CodeWeavers Wine 11 tarball
- `scripts/prep-build-deps.sh`      — Rosetta 2 + x86_64 Homebrew + brew deps
- `scripts/patch-sources.sh`        — applies `patches/wine/*.patch`
- `scripts/fixup-config-h.sh`       — post-configure patches to `include/config.h`
- `scripts/build-wine.sh`           — configure + make + install + stage to `out/engine`
- `scripts/overlay-gptk.sh`         — copies Apple GPTK D3DMetal into out/engine/lib/external
- `scripts/sign-engine.sh`          — adhoc sign every Mach-O with Wine entitlements
- `scripts/verify-no-copied-binaries.sh` — A1.5 enforcement (AGENTS rule #1)
- `scripts/test-engine.sh`          — runs A1.1, A1.2, A1.3, A1.5 in sequence

### Patches kept (in `patches/wine/`)

- `0003-rename-wineloader-id.patch` — see ADR-0009. Replaces
  `com.codeweavers.CrossOver.wineloader` bundle id with
  `app.calimocho.wineloader`. Required for AGENTS rule #3
  (don't impersonate CodeWeavers' code-signing identity).

### Patches dropped

- `0001-winemac-metallayer-arm64.patch` — only needed for native arm64
  build; ADR-0010 pivoted to x86_64.
- `0002-d3dmetal-arm64-stub.patch` — same reason.

### Errors encountered and fixed (chronological)

1. **`make: bison: invalid directive: %code`** — Apple's system bison
   is 2.3 (2008). Wine's `parser.y` needs bison ≥ 3. Fix: prepend
   `/opt/homebrew/opt/bison/bin` to PATH (later replaced by
   `/usr/local/opt/bison/bin` once we pivoted to x86_64).

2. **`include/config.h` missing `HAVE_SYS_STAT_H` etc.** — Autoconf
   2.72's autoheader stopped emitting `#define` stubs for the C99
   standard headers. CodeWeavers' `dlls/ntdll/unix/msync.c` wraps
   `#include <sys/stat.h>` in `#ifdef HAVE_SYS_STAT_H`, so
   `struct stat` becomes undefined. Same script also force-defines
   `SONAME_LIBVULKAN="libMoltenVK.dylib"` because
   `dlls/win32u/vulkan.c` references it unconditionally even with
   `--without-vulkan`. Fix: `scripts/fixup-config-h.sh`, run after
   configure.

3. **Native arm64 Wine: `WineMetalLayer` undeclared on arm64** —
   declared in `d3dmetal_objc.h` under `#if defined(__x86_64__)`.
   Patched with arm64 guard. Eventually superseded by ADR-0010.

4. **Native arm64 Wine: linker missing
   `_macdrv_client_surface_presented`** — defined in `d3dmetal.c`
   under the same `#if __x86_64__`. Patched arm64 stub. Eventually
   superseded by ADR-0010.

5. **Native arm64 Wine: every spawned wine subprocess killed by
   `AppleSystemPolicy`** — kernel log: `ASP: Security policy would
   not allow process: .../lib/wine/aarch64-unix/wine`. Hours of
   investigation: ruled out signature, entitlements, hardened runtime,
   bundle identifier, path, quarantine xattrs. Survey of Whisky's
   bundled Wine 11.9-staging, CrossOver, GPTK, gcenx confirmed **no
   shipping Wine-on-Mac stack is native arm64**. ADR-0010 pivots to
   x86_64 + Rosetta 2 (what every working stack does).

6. **x86_64 build: configure errors `libgnutls 64-bit dev files not
   found`** — arm64 Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew` is arm64-only;
   x86_64 build can't link against it. Fix: install x86_64 Homebrew
   at `/usr/local/` (under Rosetta), install the same brew formulae
   in the x86_64 keg. `scripts/prep-build-deps.sh` does this.

7. **x86_64 build: configure error `FreeType 64-bit dev files not
   found`** — Wine probes some headers (`ft2build.h`, sdl2) by
   direct compile rather than pkg-config. Fix: set
   `CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
   -I/usr/local/opt/freetype/include/freetype2 …` and
   `LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib` for the configure run.

8. **A1.3 runtime: "Wine cannot find the FreeType font library"** —
   Wine `dlopen`s libfreetype by SONAME (`libfreetype.6.dylib`) at
   runtime; default dyld search path doesn't include `/usr/local/lib`
   from Rosetta processes. Fix: set
   `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib` when invoking
   `bin/wine`. Long-term Phase 2: bundle libfreetype + friends into
   `out/engine/lib/external/`.

9. **A1.2 first run: "Wine Mono Installer" dialog blocks
   non-interactively** — Wine prompts on first init of a new prefix
   to download Mono and Gecko. Calimocho's scope doesn't include
   .NET-based Windows apps. Fix: set
   `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=mscoree,mshtml=` so Wine skips both prompts.
   Baked into `scripts/test-engine.sh`.

10. **A1.2 spurious "exit=0 in 6s, system.reg missing"** — a leftover
    `wineserver` from an interrupted prior run was answering the new
    wineboot request without doing real work. Fix: `scripts/test-engine.sh`
    now kills stale wineservers before A1.2 and waits up to 60s for
    `system.reg` to appear after wineboot returns (Rosetta filesystem
    latency).

### Configure flags (final, x86_64)

```bash
./configure
  --prefix=$BUILD_DIR/_install
  --enable-archs=x86_64,i386
  --without-x --disable-tests --with-mingw --with-gnutls
  --without-gstreamer --without-cms --without-coreaudio
  --without-fontconfig --without-pcap --without-vulkan
  --without-vkd3d --without-opencl
```

Run via `arch -x86_64`. Environment: brew bison/flex first in PATH,
`/usr/local/bin` (x86 brew) before `/usr/bin`, `PKG_CONFIG_*` pointing
at `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig`, `CPPFLAGS`/`LDFLAGS` set for the
header probes.

### Build durations (10-core M1 Max)

| Build | Wall time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| native arm64 (rejected, ADR-0010) | ~6 min | the build that the OS won't let you run |
| x86_64 under Rosetta | ~20 min | what we ship |
| x86_64 incremental (cached) | <1 min | for iteration |

### What was NOT done in Phase 1 (per scope)

- No GUI / no Calimocho.app (Phase 2)
- No DMG (Phase 4)
- No CI (Phase 5)
- No bundled libfreetype/libgnutls/etc. (Phase 2 — currently relies on
  the x86_64 brew at /usr/local; will be embedded under
  `out/engine/lib/external/` for distribution)
- A1.4 Steam login deferred — requires the Phase 2 first-run wizard's
  "Install Steam" flow; will be retested when that exists. Engine is
  ready to run Steam once a prefix has Steam installed in it.

## 2026-06-01 — CW HACK 22434 discovered: CEF GPU crash root cause

Adversarial investigation against installed CrossOver 26.5 to determine
whether the Steam black-screen issue was (a) a missing config in our
build or (b) held-back patches in the LGPL release.

Result: **(a) — a missing env var, not held-back patches.**

- `strings(1)` on CrossOver's `ntdll.so` revealed `CX_APPLEGPTK_LIBD3DSHARED_PATH`
- Same string appears in our compiled `ntdll.so` (proves the patch is in the LGPL release)
- Wine source `dlls/ntdll/unix/loader.c:1303-1352` (CW HACK 22434) +
  `dlls/ntdll/unix/unix_private.h:600-624` (CX Hack 23015) read this env var to
  hook D3DMetal's ms_abi callbacks
- Without the env var, asm trampolines unconditionally use sysv calling convention
  → register corruption when D3DMetal calls back into wine
  → CEF GPU subprocess STATUS_BREAKPOINT (0xC0000005)
  → 6+ crashes → CEF disables GPU → black window

Fix: `export CX_APPLEGPTK_LIBD3DSHARED_PATH=$ENGINE/lib/external/libd3dshared.dylib`
in `bin/calimocho-wine`. Documented in [ADR-0013](ADR/0013-cw-hack-22434-d3dshared-env.md).

Also discovered three operational gaps:
1. `scripts/sign-engine.sh` had never been run after the Wine 11 full-features
   rebuild — every Mach-O in the engine was unsigned, blocking dylib loads
   under macOS hardened runtime
2. `cp` of `libd3dshared.dylib` from `/Applications/Game Porting Toolkit.app/`
   propagates `com.apple.quarantine` xattr; needs `xattr -c` after copy or
   `cp -X` to skip xattrs
3. `bin/calimocho-wine` in the repo and `out/engine/bin/calimocho-wine` are
   separate files — must be sync'd after every edit (build-app.sh handles this
   via rsync but ad-hoc edits don't)

Verification:
- Before fix: 6+ `exit_code=-2147483645` per launch, `variations_crash_streak=6`
- After fix: 0 crashes, GPU subprocess stays alive, GPU not disabled by CEF

Remaining (NOT this ADR's scope): ANGLE's D3D11 init still fails
(`Renderer11.cpp:1108 Error querying driver version from DXGI Adapter`)
causing fallback to GLES 2.0, which is below CEF compositor minimum, so the
window paints but renders black. Investigating whether DXVK overrides are
actually applying or if wined3d's DXGI shim needs additional config.
