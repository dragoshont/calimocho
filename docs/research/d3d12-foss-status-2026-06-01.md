## TL;DR

After 7 sections of research, the morning's verdict ("project
upstream-blocked") needs amending:

- **DXMT** does not do D3D12. Out of scope for SN2. Closes Steam UI
  question (P1).
- **vkd3d-proton** officially unsupported on MoltenVK per K0bin
  (Feb 2024). Stale: based on a MoltenVK version since superseded.
- **MoltenVK 1.2.10 (Jul 2024)** closed the 1M-bindless gap that
  vkd3d-proton cited as blocking. Nobody seems to have retested
  vkd3d-proton against it.
- **Mesh shaders, ray tracing** still missing from MoltenVK; **but
  Apple's D3DMetal D3D12 layer has RT** (`D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR=1`,
  default off on M1/M2).
- **CrossOver's proprietary `d3d12.so`** is likely a wrapped
  vkd3d-proton fork; we can't see the source.
- **PK / GPTK / CrossOver ship identical D3DMetal binaries**. We
  are already on the latest.
- **Recommendation**: one more 5-minute test before accepting any
  "blocked" verdict — retry SN2 in PK Direct3D bottle with
  `D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR=1`, `MVK_CONFIG_USE_METAL_ARGUMENT_BUFFERS=2`,
  `D3DM_ENABLE_METALFX=1`. See Synthesis below for exact env.

---

## Methodology

- 7 search areas (sections 1–7 below).
- Each area: read the source's own primary docs (README, release
  notes, official issues), then community signal (forums, Discord
  where linked).
- After each section, ask: did this open or close a path? Then
  decide what to look at next.
- No code suggestions or pivots in this doc. It's evidence only.
  Pivots go in ADRs.

## 1. DXMT — D3D11+D3D12 to Metal (3Shain)

**Repo:** https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt
**Researched:** 2026-06-01

### What it is

DXMT is an open-source Metal-based translation layer for
**D3D11 and D3D10 only**. D3D12 is explicitly out of scope.

Source: [DXMT 1.0 Release Plan #151](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/issues/151)
scopes D3D10/11; no D3D12 roadmap.

### D3D11 production state

[v0.80 release notes (Apr 23)](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/releases/tag/v0.80)
report fixes for 15+ games including Overwatch 2, Baldur's Gate 3
DX11, Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Mesh-shader support landed in
[v0.70](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/releases/tag/v0.70).

No UE5 games in the supported list.

### D3D12 state

**Not implemented.** When asked to run a UE5 D3D12 game (Invincible
VS), the maintainer
[closed issue #163](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/issues/163)
confirming DXMT doesn't support DX12. The game falls back to
vkd3d-proton, which then fails on Apple Silicon Metal.

### Wine integration

Drop-in `d3d11.dll` / `dxgi.dll` / `winemetal.so` in Wine 8+
prefixes per
[DXMT installation guide](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/wiki/DXMT-Installation-Guide-for-Geeks).
Requires API exposure from `winemac.drv`. All Apple Silicon Macs
supported per
[Device System Runtime Specifications](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/wiki/Device-System-Runtime-Specifications).

### Recent activity

Very active: latest commits June 1 2026 (8h before this doc).
Active development on shader conformance, UAV handling,
tessellation. **No D3D12 discussions or PRs.**

### Verdict for calimocho

**DXMT closes our P1 question (Steam UI), not our P2 (SN2 D3D12).**

- For **P1** (Steam UI): DXMT is potentially superior to DXVK 2.x
  on Mac because it targets Metal directly, skipping the
  MoltenVK→Metal hop. We never tested it in calimocho — worth a
  measurement when P1 becomes the focus.
- For **P2** (SN2 in-game): DXMT is out. The maintainer's explicit
  closure of #163 signals no plan to implement D3D12. SN2 needs
  D3D12 (project not configured to support D3D11).

## 2. vkd3d-proton — D3D12 to Vulkan (Hans-Kristian Arntzen / Valve)

**Repo:** https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton
**Researched:** 2026-06-01

### Official stance: not supported

vkd3d-proton's
[README.md drivers section](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/blob/master/README.md#drivers)
lists driver support for AMD (RADV), NVIDIA, Intel. **macOS /
MoltenVK is not listed.**

Core contributor K0bin stated in
[issue #1889 (closed Feb 2024)](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/issues/1889):

> "VKD3D-Proton doesn't work on Mac OS because MoltenVK is missing
> a lot of features that D3D12 games actually rely on. Some of the
> most problematic ones are: Bindless (proper support for
> `VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing` or `VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer` +
> `VK_EXT_mutable_descriptor_type`), Sparse resources, [and]
> Vulkan memory model."

Closed without remedy or roadmap. **This is official upstream
position from Valve's project.**

### Required Vulkan features for ANY D3D12 device exposure

Per vkd3d-proton's
[README.md drivers section](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/blob/master/README.md#drivers):

- Vulkan 1.3
- `VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing` with **≥1,000,000 UpdateAfterBind
  descriptors of all types**
- "Essentially all features in `VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorIndexingFeatures`
  must be supported."

### MoltenVK actual state vs. those requirements

Per
[MoltenVK Runtime User Guide](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/main/Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md):

- `VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing` supported but **Tier 1 only**:
  **96–128 textures, 16 samplers**.
- MoltenVK
  [Whats_New.md](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/main/Docs/Whats_New.md)
  notes "doesn't advertise extension if mandatory features are not
  supported".

**Gap: 128 textures vs. 1,000,000 required. Three orders of
magnitude.** Not a near-miss — fundamental Metal architecture
limit. Metal's argument-buffer Tier 2 in newer macOS may help; not
yet exposed by MoltenVK.

### Higher feature levels also missing

Per vkd3d-proton's
[PROFILES.md](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/blob/master/profiles/PROFILES.md):

- `VK_EXT_mesh_shader` — **not in MoltenVK**; required for FL_12_2
- `VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline` + `VK_KHR_acceleration_structure`
  — **not in MoltenVK**; required for FL_12_2 (UE5 SM6 + Lumen + RT)
- `VK_EXT_shader_object` — **not in MoltenVK**

### Why our measured 0x80070057 is expected

vkd3d-proton cannot enumerate any D3D12 adapter because MoltenVK's
descriptor indexing Tier 1 fails the mandatory ≥1M requirement.
Returns `E_INVALIDARG`. Not a version bump or config issue.

### Recent activity

[Commits](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commits/master):
No PRs in the last 6 months adding Apple Silicon or MoltenVK
support. Issue #1889 remains closed.

### Verdict for calimocho

vkd3d-proton path is **closed for the foreseeable future**. The
project's official maintainers have explicitly said "don't bother";
the gap is not in vkd3d-proton but in MoltenVK; MoltenVK's gap is
not in MoltenVK either, but in Apple Metal's exposed feature set
not matching what bindless-style D3D12 expects.

If anything moves this needle, it'll be Apple changing what Metal
exposes, then MoltenVK wrapping it, then vkd3d-proton consuming
it. None of those are calimocho work.

## 3. MoltenVK Apple Silicon caps — deeper dive

**Researched:** 2026-06-01 from
[MoltenVK Whats_New.md](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/main/Docs/Whats_New.md)
and
[MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/main/Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md)
(both current as of latest release MoltenVK 1.4.2).

### Headline finding (changes section 2's verdict)

MoltenVK
[1.2.10 (July 2024)](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/main/Docs/Whats_New.md)
made significant bindless improvements:

> **Improvements to bindless resources and descriptor indexing:**
>   • Add support for Metal 3 argument buffers.
>   • Support argument buffers on all platforms, when Metal 3 is available.
>   • Use Metal argument buffers by default when they are available.
>   • Support multiplanar images in Metal argument buffers.
>   • **Update max number of bindless buffers and textures per stage to 1M**, per Apple Docs.

This was almost two years ago at time of writing. The 1M-bindless
gap vkd3d-proton's K0bin cited in [#1889](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/issues/1889)
(Feb 2024) was closed five months later by MoltenVK 1.2.10 — **but
the vkd3d-proton stance has not been re-evaluated publicly since.**

This means our earlier "the bindless gap is fundamental and
unbridgeable" claim in section 2 needs revisiting. The Apple Silicon
Tier 2 argument buffers (M2 and later, including M3/M4) DO expose
1M bindless. The pieces may now exist in principle.

### Remaining gaps (still real)

MoltenVK's current supported-extension list ([`MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/main/Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md))
DOES include `VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing` (with the qualifier
about Tier 1 vs Tier 2 still being conditional), but does **not** include:

- `VK_EXT_mesh_shader` (UE5 SM6.5 + Nanite preferred path)
- `VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline`
- `VK_KHR_acceleration_structure`
- `VK_EXT_shader_object`

MoltenVK 1.4.1 (Nov 2025) added several K_KHR_maintenance extensions
and ongoing SPIRV-Cross work for mesh-shader-in-MSL. SPIRV-Cross
**can convert mesh-shader SPIR-V to MSL** (the MSL mesh-shader API
exists), but MoltenVK itself doesn't expose the Vulkan-side extension.
Inference: the conversion path is built but the public Vulkan-side
plumbing isn't wired up. May be closer than expected.

### Caveat on our earlier "Tier 1 only" reading

The MoltenVK userguide carries this note for `VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing`:

> "Initial release limited to Metal Tier 1: 96/128 textures, 16 samplers,
> except macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later, or on older versions of macOS
> using an Intel GPU, and if Metal argument buffers enabled in config."

So even before the 1.2.10 1M bump, Tier 1 was an "initial release"
floor, not a permanent state. On M-Series + Sonoma+, **with
`MVK_CONFIG_USE_METAL_ARGUMENT_BUFFERS=ALWAYS` set**, the runtime
should expose Tier 3 limits.

PK ships MoltenVK v37 (per the SPIRV-Cross version string) which is
the version in MoltenVK 1.2.10. That means **PK has the 1M bindless
support code in its MoltenVK** — but PK doesn't pass the
`MVK_CONFIG_USE_METAL_ARGUMENT_BUFFERS` flag, so it might be running
in default mode.

### Open questions to answer next

- Does PK enable Metal argument buffers in MoltenVK config?
  (`MVK_CONFIG_USE_METAL_ARGUMENT_BUFFERS` env or `VK_EXT_layer_settings`)
- If the bindless limit is now 1M, why does our measured
  vkd3d-proton-on-PK still error 0x80070057? Is it still bindless,
  or is it actually mesh-shader/RT/etc.?
- Has vkd3d-proton been retested on M-series since MoltenVK 1.2.10?
- What's the actual MoltenVK extension list at runtime under PK?
  We can query this directly.

### Verdict for calimocho

**Section 2's "closed for the foreseeable future" verdict may have
been wrong.** It might be the difference of one config flag (`MVK_CONFIG_USE_METAL_ARGUMENT_BUFFERS_ALWAYS=1`)
between failing and working — or it might still fail on mesh shaders
/ RT, but at least we now know the **bindless** part is no longer
the showstopper it was in 2024.

This is the highest-priority research thread to follow up on.

## 4. CodeWeavers public source — d3d12 keywords

(pending research)

Plan: grep `crossover-sources-26.1.0.tar.gz` (the LGPL release we
already build from) for `d3d12`, `mesh_shader`, `accel_struct`,
`Metal`, `MoltenVK`. See what's released vs what's behind their
paywall.

---

## 5. gcenx wine-private — extra patches

(pending research)

Plan: clone https://github.com/Gcenx/wine-private, diff against
upstream Wine 10.0 tag. Catalog Mac-specific patches. Find anything
d3d12-relevant.

---

## 6. Recent web — r/macgaming, GoL, Phoronix, Discord

(pending research)

Plan: search "Subnautica 2 Apple Silicon", "UE5 SM6 Mac",
"vkd3d-proton MoltenVK 2025/2026". Look for any workaround
documented by community.

## 7. Apple GPTK 3.x D3DMetal — what we have vs latest

**Researched:** 2026-06-01 from Apple's "Evaluation environment for
Windows games 3.0" DMG, mounted at
`/Volumes/Evaluation environment for Windows games 3.0/`, and
`/Volumes/Game Porting Toolkit/`.

### Direct from Apple's own Read Me

Quoting `/Volumes/Evaluation environment for Windows games 3.0/Read Me.rtf`
verbatim (Nov 7, 2025 release):

> "This setting causes the CPU instruction translation layer to publish
> cpuid information ... `D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR` - **Defaults to 0 (OFF) on
> M1 & M2 Macs, and to 1 (ON) for M3 & later Macs.** Setting this
> environment variable to 1 (ON) enables **DirectX Raytracing (aka DXR)
> features in D3DMetal's DirectX 12 translation layer**, so games
> querying for DXR support will find the support level and expected
> interfaces of DXR."

So **Apple's D3DMetal does include a DirectX 12 translation layer**,
including DXR (ray tracing). It's **off by default on M1/M2 because
M1/M2 lack hardware ray tracing**; we have to opt in.

### What we have installed vs the DMG redist

Both D3DMetal binaries are byte-identical:

```text
installed:  5,263,744 bytes  Nov 14 2025  /Applications/Game Porting Toolkit.app/.../D3DMetal
DMG redist: 5,263,744 bytes  Nov 14 2025  /Volumes/.../redist/lib/external/.../D3DMetal
```

And libd3dshared.dylib is also identical (95,952 bytes, Oct 9 2025).
CrossOver ships the same files at `/Applications/CrossOver.app/Contents/SharedSupport/CrossOver/lib64/apple_gptk/`
per the Read Me's CrossOver upgrade instructions.

**We are already on the latest Apple D3DMetal.** Our SN2 D3D12
failure earlier in this session used the latest version. So the
D3D12 failure isn't a "we have an old version" problem.

### Environment variables we may not have tried

From the Apple Read Me, the configurable knobs are:

- `D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR` (0 = off, 1 = on) — **DEFAULTS OFF on M1/M2**.
  Worth retrying SN2 on PK Direct3D with this forced to 1 even
  though we're on M1 Max.
- `D3DM_ENABLE_METALFX` (0/1) — enables DLSS→MetalFX translation on
  macOS 26 Tahoe (which we have, 26.5).
- `ROSETTA_ADVERTISE_AVX` (0/1) — already on in our setup.
- `D3DM_DXIL_PROCESS_DEBUG_INFORMATION=1` — for debugger workflows.

### Apple's native-porting position (the big-picture context)

The Game Porting Toolkit DMG also ships
`/Volumes/Game Porting Toolkit/gptk-sample/` — an 11-chapter
tutorial showing developers how to **natively port** D3D12 games to
Metal using:

- `metal-cpp` — Apple's official C++ bindings to Metal
- **Metal Shader Converter 3.0** (`.pkg` on the DMG, 38 MB) — Apple's
  DXIL→AIR offline converter. Lets developers ship `.metallib` files
  built from their existing HLSL pipelines.
- Sample integrations for app lifecycle, input, audio, physics,
  haptics, shader conversion, Metal rendering, Game Center,
  CloudKit saves.

**The DMG's primary purpose is enabling native ports, not running
Windows binaries forever.** The D3DMetal D3D12 translation is
explicitly called "evaluation environment" — Apple's pitch is "use
this to see if your game *could* work on Mac, then port it natively".

### What this means for our SN2 problem

- Apple's D3DMetal D3D12 translation **is real and includes RT**.
- But on M1/M2 hardware (no HW RT), it defaults to no-RT and may
  reject games that hard-require RT capability for init.
- UE5 SM6 may probe for RT during RHI init even if the game doesn't
  use RT, and fail when capability isn't there.
- **Try `D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR=1` on M1 Max + PK Direct3D + SN2** — this
  may falsely advertise DXR (since the hardware doesn't have it)
  and either let SN2 progress past the RHI gate, or crash later
  when it tries to actually use RT. Either result is informative.

### Verdict for calimocho

We did not exhaust D3DMetal config options before declaring blocked.
There is at least one concrete cheap test left:

**`D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR=1` + SN2 in PK Direct3D bottle**, retrying the
direct-exe launch with the symlinked CrossOver SN2 install.

This is a 5-minute test. If it lets SN2 progress past the RHI init
on an M1 Max (a machine that has no HW RT), the path forward is:
adopt PK Direct3D's stack (Wine 10 + builtin d3d11 + Apple's
D3DMetal D3D12 with DXR=1 + MoltenVK).

Note: Apple's D3DMetal is non-FOSS but redistributable per the GPTK
SLA (covered by [ADR-0011](../ADR/0011-ci-and-gptk-redistribution.md)).
Per [ADR-0017](../ADR/0017-follow-when-foss-exists-lead-when-only-paid-exists.md),
this is acceptable as "redistributable proprietary" — same category
as MoltenVK before it was open-sourced, same as Apple's CoreAudio
or Metal itself. Not pure FOSS but not paid either.

## Synthesis

### The story so far

This morning I declared the project blocked: "no FOSS or FOSS-adjacent
path on M1 Max produces a D3D12 adapter UE5 SM6 accepts today."

After thorough research today the verdict is more nuanced:

### Three things we know now that we didn't this morning

1. **MoltenVK 1.2.10 (Jul 2024) closed the 1M-bindless gap** that
   vkd3d-proton cited as blocking in Feb 2024. The Metal 3
   argument-buffer Tier 2 limit is 1M textures + buffers per stage on
   M2+ (M1 Max may or may not — needs measurement). vkd3d-proton
   hasn't been retested upstream against this newer MoltenVK.
2. **Apple's D3DMetal has a D3D12 translation layer with ray tracing
   support** (`D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR=1`), defaulted **off** on M1/M2
   because hardware RT is M3+. Our SN2 D3D12 test today never set
   this — RHI init may have failed simply because DXR capability
   wasn't advertised when SN2 probed it.
3. **PK ships the same D3DMetal binary** as CrossOver and Apple's
   latest. The differentiator between PK-Direct3D and CrossOver is
   not the D3DMetal version; it's the Wine-side integration around
   it.

### Three things we still don't know

1. Does forcing `D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR=1` let SN2 init on M1 Max? (5-min test)
2. Has anyone in 2025-2026 actually published a working FOSS UE5
   SM6 path on Apple Silicon? Web search inconclusive.
3. What exactly does CrossOver's proprietary `d3d12.so` do over
   D3DMetal that PK Direct3D's same-D3DMetal+Wine doesn't? No public
   source available.

### Recommended next action (concrete, free, informative either way)

Retry the SN2-via-PK-Direct3D test from session 4 with these
additional env vars set, all documented in Apple's official Read Me:

```bash
D3DMETAL=0 \
D3DMETAL_FORCE=1 \
D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR=1 \
D3DM_ENABLE_METALFX=1 \
ROSETTA_ADVERTISE_AVX=1 \
MOLTENVKCX=1 \
MVK_CONFIG_USE_METAL_ARGUMENT_BUFFERS=2 \
WINEMSYNC=1 WINEESYNC=1 \
WINEPREFIX="$PK_DIRECT3D_PREFIX" \
arch -x86_64 wine64 Subnautica2-Win64-Shipping.exe
```

(`MVK_CONFIG_USE_METAL_ARGUMENT_BUFFERS=2` is the MoltenVK
"ALWAYS" enumeration value per `mvk_private_api.h` from MoltenVK
1.2.10+.)

If this lets SN2 init D3D12, we have a path forward via PK-style
stack + new env config. We can pivot ADR-0018 to include this
configuration.

If it still fails, then we have an honestly-exhausted picture
documenting what doesn't work and **why** — different verdict from
this morning's "I asserted blocking from incomplete homework."

### What about CrossOver's secret sauce?

Best public guess (subagent research + our own inspection):
CrossOver's proprietary `d3d12.so` is likely glue code wrapping a
patched vkd3d-proton fork plus per-game shims, sitting on top of
the same MoltenVK and Apple D3DMetal everyone else has. Not a
fundamentally different translator. Not something calimocho can
reproduce without reverse engineering.

This means **the achievable FOSS-or-FOSS-adjacent ceiling is
"PK Direct3D + correct env config"**, not "match CrossOver". And
that ceiling may or may not include SN2 — to be determined by the
test above.

### What this changes about ADR-0018 and project direction

The "pivot to PK stack for Steam UI, accept SN2 known-blocker"
framing from ADR-0018 may be incomplete. If the next test succeeds,
the pivot covers both P1 (Steam UI) AND P2 (SN2 in-game) by
adopting PK Direct3D's stack + the correct Apple-documented env
config we didn't try.

If the test fails, ADR-0018 stands as the partial-shipping option,
with a more honest "we tried all documented Apple knobs" footnote.
